Changelog for ScirtScan

v1.3, 20230322
	* added a check to see if the website certificate is valid and if it's
	going to expire within 30 days
	* added a check to validate that HTTP requests get redirected to HTTPS
	* replaced Qualys ssllabs-scan-v3 with python function that uses the
	API directly, so thats not a dependency anymore
	* added a no-cache commandline option to force Qualys to do a new
	check even if the old check is less than 24 hours old
	N.B. the SQlite database format has changed because of the new checks,
	so the new sql2html (v1.3) will give errors on old versions of
	websites.db

v1.2a, 20230226
	* scirtscan.py bugfix where shcheck.py would not return json because
	of a HTTP 5xx or an invalid certificate, this error is now caught and
	properly dealt with
	* scirtscan.py addition of check_dns function to validate that a
	website name from the list resolves or otherwise move on to the next
	one, because of the use of dnspython for this, requirements.txt is
	also updated. The DNS info is also written to the per-website log file
	so you can check if this info changes over time, as long as you keep
	that information
