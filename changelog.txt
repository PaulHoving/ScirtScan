Changelog for ScirtScan

v2.0, upcoming
	* config file to read specific values (e.g. CERT name in UserAgent)
	and specify which checks should be done and which shouldn't
	* database format stored in sqlite database itself, so sql2html 
	and sql2excel will allways work regardless of what's in the database.
	* maybe facilitate the upload of a new list op websites to scan
	through the HTML page, so this can be used without shell access?
	* will look into more output tools, e.g. a pie-chart to show how your
	compliance is on a certain topic (e.g. SSLtest scores) and possibly a
	graph over time to show improvement or getting worse
	* will look into options for e-mail alerting if compliance on a certain topic
	has failed for a website between consecutive checks
	* will look into an option to specify primary websites (e.g.  www.company.tld ) 
	and have those shown first in the webpage

v1.5, 20230326
	* HSTS duration is now stored separately and shown in a seperate column
	* improved per-website logging

v1.4, 20230325
	* removing the dependency of shcheck.py and doing these checks from
	within the function & writing all raw headers to the per website logfile.
	scroll
	* adding an option to sort the table on website name, certificate age, SSLtest
	score, and even the rest, so you can easily see whats most urgent
	* changed the  option for debug.log to -ndf (no debug log), so now
	debug.log is always written, except if you explicitly tell it not to 

v1.3a, 20230323
	* added an option (-df) to write debug.log to a file in the YYYYMMDD
	directory, so it's allways available for review
	* added a user-agent that shows who is doing the scanning, and a -a
	option to use a user-agent without telling that

v1.3, 20230322
	* added a check to see if the website certificate is valid and if it's
	going to expire within 30 days
	* added a check to validate that HTTP requests get redirected to HTTPS
	* replaced Qualys ssllabs-scan-v3 with python function that uses the
	API directly, so thats not a dependency anymore
	* added a no-cache commandline option to force Qualys to do a new
	check even if the old check is less than 24 hours old
	* added a defined user-agent string which is used with the HTTPS requests, 
	so it shows which entity is doeing the checks (best practice).
	** N.B. the SQlite database format has changed because of the new checks,
	so the new sql2html (v1.3) may give errors on old versions of
	websites.db (but only fields are added, so probably you're fine)
	** TBD. sql2excel needs to be adapted to the extra fields in the database

v1.2a, 20230226
	* scirtscan.py bugfix where shcheck.py would not return json because
	of a HTTP 5xx or an invalid certificate, this error is now caught and
	properly dealt with
	* scirtscan.py addition of check_dns function to validate that a
	website name from the list resolves or otherwise move on to the next
	one, because of the use of dnspython for this, requirements.txt is
	also updated. The DNS info is also written to the per-website log file
	so you can check if this info changes over time, as long as you keep
	that information

v1.2, 20230226
	* scirtscan.py, added option to view version info (-v, --view)
	* added sql2excel.py to create a excel file from websites.db
	* added requirements_sql2excel.txt if you want to use sql2excel.py
	* added changelog.txt (this file)

v1.1 20230220
	* scirtscan.py, added check for .well-known/security.txt as per rfc9116
	* sql2html.py, added support for the security.txt check
